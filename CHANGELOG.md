# Changelog

All notable changes to diffStory are tracked here.

## Unreleased

- Story format v4: concept steps can be free HTML pages (JavaScript and CDN
  libraries allowed) rendered in a sandboxed frame, with no cap on how many or
  where they sit.
- Concept pages are offline by default: a page opts into network access with
  `"network": true` on its step, and opted-in pages carry a Network badge.
- Story bundles for team handoff: export a story as a `.diffstory.json`
  download and import it under `.diffstory/stories/` from Review history.
- `storyScope.regenerated` declares generator outputs (ABIs, lockfiles) once
  with their command instead of narrating them as steps; coverage treats them
  as explained and the file list shows one row per generator.
- Step `weight` (`must`/`skim`): the rail collapses skim runs, and a
  must-read-only mode skips them in keyboard order and narration.
- Story health row in the Overview: contract errors, lint findings grouped by
  rule, and runtime diagram failures, each with step jump and agent repair.
- Cross-file sweep steps: one tagged step names a glob for a repeated
  mechanical pattern, coverage claims every matched file, and the checker
  verifies each matched file carries the same structural edit.
- Old-side beat highlights: beats about removed code point `oldHighlights` at
  deleted OLD-side line numbers, which glow the red rows and speak as
  "deleted lines N"; the checker verifies they hit real deletions.
- Story health sections cap at ten rows with an overflow count, so large
  stories keep a light Overview; a perf smoke test pins the 300-step review
  page inside a 5s budget.
- History snapshots no longer dirty the tree for scope selection: the
  committed-story fallback and auto scope ignore `.diffstory/history/`, so a
  clean tree with snapshots still opens its committed diff.
- Tightened the story step header: the step title now leads its own line with
  the step number, kind, and call flow demoted to quiet reference marks at the
  end of the same row, instead of sitting in a band of filled chips above it.
  Story diff heads no longer spell out an unrenamed path twice, and the step
  toolbar dropped controls it never showed. Together this returns about 30px of
  vertical space per step and puts the title first in reading order.
- Paired deleted and added lines onto single side-by-side rows in the Split and
  full-file views, with word-level change marks on both sides of each pair, so a
  rewritten statement reads as one before/after row instead of two separate
  blocks.
- Marked absent-side regions in split panes with a quiet hatch so added or
  removed blocks read as "did not exist here" instead of blank space.
- Added a sticky enclosing-scope label to each split hunk so long functions stay
  oriented while scrolling.
- Decluttered the split header, which now shows paths only for renames, added
  +N −M change stats to each file panel, and gave the expand-context controls
  readable labels.
- Added restrained diff annotations to guided stories: measured region boxes and
  gutter arrows draw on split panes, while invisible paths, destinations, and
  consequences render as accessible in-flow callouts.
- Added live review synchronization: agent replies, review-state changes, story
  updates, and working-tree diff drift now reach an open review page over a
  server-sent event stream instead of requiring manual reloads. Reviews stay
  live across bfcache restores, tolerate a story rewrite mid-review, and never
  report a persisted comment change as failed.
- Added interleaved concept primers so generated stories can teach new terms and
  mental models before the code that uses them, with optional local Mermaid
  diagrams and no effect on diff coverage.
- Keep clone-and-run setup easy for new users.
- Keep optional integrations clearly separated from the core app.

## 0.1.0

- Added the local browser review app for git diffs.
- Added guided story review files under `.diffstory/story.json`.
- Added selected-text comments and agent handoff for Claude/Codex.
- Added optional local read-aloud support, including optional Kokoro AI voice
  setup.
- Added npm packaging metadata, bundled skills, brand assets, and public launch
  docs.
