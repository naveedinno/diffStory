# Story file schema and narrative markup

Part of the diffstory-storyteller skill. Read immediately before writing or editing story JSON.

## File contract

The checker enforces every line of this; knowing it saves a rewrite.

- Every story under `.diffstory/stories/` carries a top-level `storyScope` with
  `includedFiles`, and every code step's `file` appears in it. The app rejects
  the story otherwise.
- Newly generated stories use `"version": 4`. Older versions stay readable; do
  not rewrite an existing story just to modernize its number. A `page` concept
  needs version 4, so raise an older story to 4 when you add one.
- Every newly generated story carries `storyArc` with `changeType`, `shape`, and
  a plain-text `readingPath` naming the real review stages in story order with
  ASCII ` -> ` separators.
- Add `evolution` only when the prompt supplies an eligible frozen first-parent
  manifest. Author `phases`, `firstCommit`, `lastCommit`, optional
  `relatedSteps`; never author server-owned `baseSha` or `headSha`.
- Set `base` to the ref you diffed against; set `head` only for fixed
  `base..head` stories.
- Never use "deleted" as a step kind. For deleted files, use kind "changed" and
  anchor the range at the post-change deletion location.
- For a whole deleted file, use `range`, `viewport`, and `highlights` of `[0, 0]`.
  Do not invent line 1 for a file that no longer exists.
- `range`: post-change, 1-based inclusive lines; the tight local camera anchor.
  When top-level `ranges` is absent, `range` is also the step's complete
  coverage claim.
- Optional top-level `ranges`: the complete list of post-change spans a
  `changed`/`new-file` step claims. Only for one repeated mechanical pattern in
  one file. `range` must be contained in one entry; other entries may sit
  outside `viewport`; `range` is never their bounding box.
- `viewport`: post-change lines the diff viewer shows. `highlights`: post-change
  ranges inside `viewport`; the lines the story is currently talking about.
  Full contracts: `references/camera-and-coverage.md`.
- `context` steps show unchanged code that helps judge a changed path; they
  never claim coverage and never carry `ranges`. `concept` steps are fileless
  pages (`page` + `narration`); same rule. Their full shape is in
  `references/primers.md`.
- Optional `landing` on code steps (never on concept steps): `symbol`
  (required), `calledBy` (1-3 names) or `role` (`who`, optional `gate`), and
  optional `when`; plain text, each at most 80 characters (`role.who` 40). The
  checker verifies that each caller shares a file with the symbol and that a
  gate is written in the step's file. The app shows it under the step title.

#### Narrative fields are HTML

Story prose is restricted HTML, not Markdown: `**bold**` renders literally.

| Field | You may write |
| --- | --- |
| concept `body` (legacy) | block HTML: `<p> <h2>-<h4> <ul> <ol> <li> <blockquote> <pre> <hr> <table> <caption> <thead> <tbody> <tr> <th> <td> <dl> <dt> <dd>`, plus the inline set |
| `why`, `beats[].text`, `summary`, `intent.goal`, `intent.design`, `intent.nonGoals[]`, `hotspots[].reason`, `moves[].hidden.what` | inline only: `<code> <kbd> <strong> <em> <sup> <sub> <span> <br>` |
| concept `page` | any complete HTML document; never sanitized; runs sandboxed |
| concept `narration` | plain text, no tags |
| every `title`, `moves[].label`, `moves[].hidden.tag`, `storyScope.reviewerNote`, `landing.*` | plain text — no tags at all |

Allowed attributes: `class` on `<span> <code> <td> <th>` (one of `ds-bit`,
`ds-slot`, `ds-flag`, `ds-val`, `ds-warn`), `scope` on `<th>`,
`colspan`/`rowspan` (1-20), `data-lang` on `<pre>`. No links, images, SVG,
`id`, or `style`. Writing about a tag? Escape it: `&lt;script&gt;`. These
rules cover the prose fields only; a concept `page` is its own document.

**Every `<table>` needs a `<caption>`; a table without one is dropped.** The
caption is what the read-aloud voice speaks *in place of* the table, so write
it as the sentence you would say if the table were not there. Use a table only
when a bit layout, encoding map, or state transition is clearer as a grid.

Legacy concept steps (a `body` instead of a `page`) may carry a Mermaid
`diagram`. Keep it intact when repairing; if you must edit it, the legacy rules
still hold. It earns its place only when it materially clarifies three or more
actors/components, a real branch, or a state transition: `flowchart`, `sequenceDiagram`, or `stateDiagram-v2`; a caption is required.
No links, URLs, `click`/`href` directives, init/config directives, HTML, images, or custom styling directives.

Use `"mode": "brief"` for the shortest useful story and `"mode": "detailed"`
for the line-by-line correctness story. Omit `head` for working tree vs base.

## Schema spot-check

Schema spot-check, especially on long stories. Long stories are where authors
drift into an abbreviated shape, and the app rejects the whole story over it.
Confirm, in order: top level has `title` and `summary`; every step has `id`,
`order` (a number — never omit it), `title`, `kind`; every code step has
`file`, `range`, `viewport`, `highlights`, `why`, `beats`; every new concept
step has `page` and `narration` and none of those code fields; a step with
`ranges` is a tagged changed/new-file sweep listing every full span and
containing `range`; every beat has `text` (never `body`) and non-empty
`highlights`. Those five — top-level `title`, top-level `summary`, step
`order`, beat `text`, beat `highlights` — are the ones real stories lose first.
