# Change-type playbooks

Part of the diffstory-storyteller skill. Read the entry for the `storyArc.changeType`
you chose, and the surface entries for the kinds of files the diff touches.
Each entry opens with the question it answers and when not to use it, then
says how to open, what order to walk, and what evidence the reviewer needs
before they can trust this kind of change.

## By change type

### bug-fix

- **Question:** What broke for whom, what caused it, and what proves the fix?
- **Avoid when:** nothing is broken; a change that only adds capability is a
  feature.
- Open on the symptom a user or caller saw, then the trigger that produces it.
  Shape `cause-effect`; a typical path is
  `symptom -> trigger -> root cause -> fix -> regression proof`.
- Name the root cause at the line where it lives, and say when there was more
  than one cause; a single "the bug was X" often hides a second.
- Put the fix at the causal point, then the regression test that fails
  without it. If you could not reproduce the failure, say so in `verification`
  and keep the claim narrow.

### feature

- **Question:** What can the caller do now, and what guards, state, and
  effects carry it?
- **Avoid when:** the diff repairs existing behavior without adding
  capability — use bug-fix.
- Open on the capability that was missing and who needed it. Shape
  `entry-implementation`: the entry point a developer recognizes, then the new
  path end to end: guards, state, effects, then the tests that pin it.
- For every new entry point, say who may call it and what stops everyone else.

### refactor

- **Question:** What structure changed while behavior stayed identical, and
  what proves it?
- **Avoid when:** behavior changes anywhere; give that its own chapter and say
  so in `summary`.
- One hat at a time. Open on what must not change (the behavior the refactor
  preserves) and why the structure changes.
- Record every relocation as a `moved`, `extracted`, or `inlined` move.
- A systematic edit is one exemplar step plus a sweep: narrate the first
  instance fully, claim the rest with top-level `ranges`, and name any
  instance that deviates from the pattern. A deviation is where refactors break.
- The proof is that behavior did not change: tests that still pass unchanged,
  or an equivalence argument at the riskiest move. If the refactor also changes
  behavior, give that its own chapter and say so in `summary`.

### security

- **Question:** What could an attacker reach, and what stops them now?
- **Avoid when:** the diff only refactors security-adjacent code without
  changing a trust boundary — use refactor.
- Open in advisory form: "<weakness> in <component> allowed <who> to <impact>
  via <vector>." Then the trust boundary, the fix at that boundary, and the
  test that attacks it.
- Say what an attacker can still do after the fix, if anything.
- Do not spell out exploit steps beyond what the diff and tests already show.

### performance

- **Question:** What cost mattered, where did it go, and what measurement
  proves it?
- **Avoid when:** nothing was measured and no cost is claimed; a cleanup with
  no cost story is maintenance.
- Open on the cost that mattered (latency, gas, memory, calls) and where it
  went. Shape `before-after`.
- Show the measurement: the benchmark, gas snapshot, or profile, before and
  after, and how it was taken. If nothing was measured, record that in
  `verification` as `not-run` and claim only what the code shows.
- Name the trade-off (memory for speed, readability for gas, a cache that can
  go stale).

### migration

For API, storage, protocol, or dependency changes other code relies on.

- **Question:** Who must act, what breaks for them, and what is the path back?
- **Avoid when:** no consumer-facing surface changes; an internal restructure
  is a refactor.
- Name the phase: expand (old and new both work), migrate (callers move), or
  contract (old path removed).
- Name the compatibility class: source, wire/ABI, storage layout, or semantic.
  Changing a default is a breaking semantic change.
- Say who must act (callers, deployers, indexers, integrators) and the
  rollback path. Put the removed or renamed surface early.

### maintenance

Dependency bumps, tooling, CI, formatting.

- **Question:** What changes for developers or the build, and what is the one
  risk worth checking?
- **Avoid when:** the diff changes product behavior or a trust boundary — use
  the matching type instead.
- Brief is usually right. Say what changes for developers or the build, and
  the one risk worth checking (a transitive behavior change, a new default).
- Lockfiles and generated output are one sweep each, never a series of steps.

### mixed

- **Question:** What are the independent concerns, and where does each start?
- **Avoid when:** the diff is one concern with supporting edits; pick that
  type and fold the rest in.
- Name each concern in `summary` ("two independent changes: X, then Y"),
  finish one before starting the next, and open each new concern by announcing
  the switch (Branch rule). Give each concern its own chapter.

## By surface

### Smart contracts (Solidity)

- **Question:** Which entry, gate, state writes, and events carry this change?
- **Avoid when:** the diff touches only contract tests, not contract code —
  pin the behavior under test and skip the state walk.
- Land on the external or public function and the role of `msg.sender`, then
  the access control that gates it (modifier, role check, pause flag).
- Walk state writes in execution order; say where checks, effects, and
  interactions happen, and which events are emitted with what payload.
- Units, decimals, and rounding direction get one concrete trace
  ("1e18 collateral at a 5% fee rounds the fee down to …").
- For upgradeable contracts, say what happens to storage layout (append-only,
  no reordering) and whether selectors or the ABI changed, and who must
  redeploy or re-integrate.

### UI and CSS

- **Question:** What does the user see before and after, at the component that
  owns it?
- **Avoid when:** the change has no visible render difference; follow the
  change type alone.
- The reviewer cannot see the render. Say what the user sees before and after,
  in words, at the component that owns it.
- Group CSS by visual outcome, not by selector; one stop per visible change.
- Hotspots go on responsive, empty, error, and focus states; `verification`
  says which browsers and sizes you actually looked at.

### Docs

- **Question:** Who reads this doc, and what can they now do or understand?
- **Avoid when:** the output is generated (API dumps, coverage) — treat it as
  config/generated.
- Say who reads the doc and what they can now do or understand.
- One stop per section whose meaning changed; wording-only edits are one sweep.
- Never hand the audit back ("spot-check the fields"). Say which facts you
  verified against code, and record the rest as a hotspot.

### Data schemas, ABIs, and indexers

- **Question:** What does existing data look like after this, and what must
  backfill or re-index?
- **Avoid when:** the change is purely additive with no consumer change; one
  stop suffices, not a migration arc.
- Show the schema and the code that writes or reads it side by side (one beat,
  or a paired view), not in two distant steps.
- Say what existing data looks like after the change and whether it needs a
  backfill or re-index.

### Config, generated files, lockfiles

- **Question:** What produced this output, and is anything hand-edited?
- **Avoid when:** a value is a real decision (a limit, an address, a flag) —
  that stop follows the change-type playbook, not this sweep.
- Never narrate them as decisions. One sweep step per generator: what produced
  the output and that nothing was hand-edited. If a value in config is a real
  decision (a limit, an address, a feature flag), it gets a normal step.
