// The `__DIFFSTORY_DATA__` payload shapes — the contract between a route
// handler and its React surface.
//
// This module carries plain JSON-serializable interfaces and nothing else. That
// is what lets `client/` import these with `import type` across the src/client
// boundary and keep ONE definition of each shape instead of two that drift.
// `import type` is erased before esbuild ever sees it, so nothing from `src/` is
// bundled into the browser.
//
// It imports types from exactly two other modules, `./types.js` and
// `./noise.js`, and only because both are themselves import-free. That matters
// more than it looks: the client typechecker runs with `types: []` and no Node
// typings, so a type-only import that transitively reaches a module with
// `import { createHash } from 'node:crypto'` (which `view-model.ts` and
// `review-state.ts` both do) fails the client build. Anything those modules own
// is therefore restated here as a narrow projection rather than re-exported.
//
// Rules for anything added here (see
// `docs/superpowers/specs/server-shell-contract.md` §1):
//   - plain JSON only. No Map, no Set, no Date — epoch milliseconds and arrays.
//   - the payload is the whole initial state; do not smuggle state into
//     `data-*` attributes on <body>.
//   - keep presentation OUT. Raw values (`path`, `lastOpened`) travel; the
//     formatting (`~/…`, "7 min ago") happens in the component.

 *
 * Two departures from the shape proposed in `server-shell-contract.md` §5.3,
 * both because the proposal described the pre-resolution arguments rather than
 * what `changeScreen()` actually has in hand:
 *
 *   - `base` / `head` are the RESOLVED scope (`resolveScope()`), not "the

 *     onto the session before rendering, so by this point `base` is always a
 *     concrete ref ('HEAD', a parent SHA, a branch name) and `head` is absent
 *     only for a working-tree comparison. They are exactly the two values the
 *     `/diff` link has to carry, which is why they travel.
 *   - `active` includes `'uncommitted'`. The proposal listed `'' | 'compare' |
 *     'commit'`; `''` is unreachable from this route and `'uncommitted'` is the
 *     value that marks the first segment `aria-current`.

// review — the review page, storyful and storyless

//
// One surface, two entry points: `GET /repo/<n>/review` renders it with a story
// and `GET /repo/<n>/diff` renders the same page with `storyless: true` and a
// synthetic empty tour. There is no separate "diff" surface.
//
// The shape below is a NARROW PROJECTION of `ReviewModel`, not the model
// itself, and that is deliberate on two counts.
//
// 1. Size. The route builds its model metadata-first — `files: []`,
//    `detailedStepIndexes: new Set()`, `detailedFilePaths: new Set()`,
//    `trustPending: true` — so that a 300-step story ships 300 tiny stubs
//    instead of 300 highlighted diffs. Shipping `ReviewModel` verbatim would
//    put every step's `blocks`, `moves` and `focusGroups` into the document and
//    quietly undo that. What travels here is what the initial DOM actually
//    renders: rail cards, filmstrip labels, speech projections, file rows.
// 2. Reachability. `ReviewModel` lives in `view-model.ts`, which imports
//    `node:crypto`; see the note at the top of this file.
//
// Everything the projection omits arrives later through the lazy endpoints,
// each of which still returns server-rendered diff HTML.
