Read a code change in the order it actually makes sense.

diffStory is a local desktop app for reviewing git diffs. Open the app,
pick a repo, choose what changed, and review the real diff with an optional
AI-written walkthrough. When something needs work, select the exact text, add a
comment, then copy it or keep it in the review queue.

- Runs locally on your machine.
- Uses a proper desktop UI, not a terminal review flow.
- Works with plain git diffs, even without generating a story.
- Draws restrained boxes and arrows directly on split diffs when code genuinely
  moved, with accessible callouts only for facts neither pane can show.
- Can use Claude or Codex to generate and repair walkthroughs.
- Works without AI. Story-writing features are optional.
- Command-click or Ctrl-click a current-code identifier to open its implementation
  through the small VS Code navigation bridge.

## Quickstart

Build requirements:

- macOS
- Node.js 20 or newer
- Rust and Cargo
- git
- a local git repository you want to review

No Python is required for the core app.

Install the macOS app from a source checkout:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/naveedinno/diffStory.git
cd diffStory
npm install
./scripts/install-macos-app.sh
```

Then open **diffStory** from Spotlight, Finder, or Launchpad. There is no
diffStory CLI and no terminal review workflow.

Optional: install Claude or Codex on your PATH if you want generated stories.

## Demo

Try a realistic throwaway review without touching your own repos:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/naveedinno/diffStory.git
cd diffStory
npm install
npm run demo
```

The demo creates a temporary git repo with a saved story, changed files, and a
couple of comments so you can see the full review loop.

## First Review

1. Make changes in any local git repo.
2. Open the **diffStory** app.
3. Pick a repo from **Choose your workspace**.
4. Choose what you want to review: uncommitted changes, the current branch, one
   commit, or any two refs.
5. Read the diff in **All files**, or open **Story** and generate a guided
   walkthrough.
6. Select exact text in the diff, right-click **Comment selected code**, choose
   **Fix request**, **Question**, or **Note**, and write the comment.
7. **Copy** is the default action and does not save anything. Use **Add to queue**
   when you want to keep the comment for the end of the review.
8. Open **Review → Comments** to edit or remove queued comments, jump back to
   their code, or use **Copy all** for one portable handoff.

You can use diffStory as a clean diff viewer without an agent. AI is only needed
when you want a generated or repaired story.

## What You See

The first screen is your project list.

- Recent repositories appear automatically after you open them once.
- **Add repository** lets you pick another local git repo.
- Missing or non-git folders are marked so you can remove them from recents.

Inside a repo, diffStory gives you two useful ways to read:

- **All files** shows the real git diff file by file.
- **Story** rebuilds the minimum app context around the task, then walks the
  existing entry point, changed decision, downstream effect, and proof in the
  order the logic flows—not alphabetically by filename. Each step frames the
  relevant surrounding code, including unchanged lines when they explain the
  boundary, and spotlights the exact evidence for each narration beat. When a
  change introduces a new term, lifecycle, or architectural boundary, the story
  can pause for a short **concept primer** before the code that depends on it.
  Primers are document steps with optional locally rendered Mermaid diagrams;
  they do not pretend to be files and do not count as diff coverage.

The story never replaces the diff. It only explains and orders it. The code you
read comes from git.

## Review Workflow

diffStory keeps long reviews oriented and makes comments portable:

- **Inline comments** open directly beneath selected code—never in a modal. The
  exact selection is the anchor and travels with the comment.
- **Copy** is primary and one-shot: it copies the type, file, line range, diff
  side, selected code, and comment without writing to `.diffstory/`.
- **Add to queue** is the only persistence action.
- **Review → Comments** groups queued comments by file. Edit or remove them,
  jump back to the code, or use **Copy all** when the review is ready.
- **Review** keeps coverage, queued comments, challenge checks, and explicit
  actions on one page.
- **File search and filters** narrow the sidebar to seen or unseen files, files with
  comments, unexplained changes, tests, or files changed since your review.
- **Resume review** returns to the last file, line, and display mode on this
  device. **Next unseen** keeps a larger review moving.
- Select diff text to reveal the quick comment action. Press `C` to comment on
  the current selection, `/` to search files, or `?` for the command palette.
- A story step can be repaired in place: ask the agent to explain it, shorten
  it, or split it without regenerating the rest of the walkthrough.
- Open a story step to land on its first spotlight, then select any narration
  beat to move the highlight to the exact lines it explains. Read-aloud follows
  the same camera path automatically.

## Agent Setup

The installer copies the bundled diffStory skills into the common agent skills
location. If the app says skills are missing or stale, use the **Update skills**
button in the browser.

Claude Code users can also install the plugin:

```text
/plugin marketplace add naveedinno/diffStory
/plugin install diffstory@diffstory
```

For Codex, Cursor, and other agents that read local skills, you can also install
the skills from a clone:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:naveedinno/diffStory.git
cd diffStory
./scripts/install-skills.sh
```

If no agent is installed, diffStory still opens and still works as a local diff
viewer with the complete comment queue. Only story generation and repair are
unavailable until Claude or Codex is on your PATH.

## Jump To Source In VS Code

Command-click on macOS or Ctrl-click elsewhere on an identifier in the
current-code side of a diff. diffStory opens the reviewed file in VS Code,
places the caret at the clicked location, and brings that line into view
without a success notification.

This uses VS Code's built-in `vscode://file/…` handler, so a stock VS Code
install is all you need — there is no companion extension.

## Review Files

diffStory stores review state inside the repo you open:

```text
.diffstory/story.json      generated reading order
.diffstory/comments.json   local queued review comments
.diffstory/review-state.json review rounds, snapshots, and timeline events
.diffstory/stories/        optional saved named stories
```

By default, keep `.diffstory/` local and add it to `.gitignore`.

If your team intentionally wants replayable walkthroughs, share a story file as
part of your review process and make that convention explicit. Comments are
normally local reviewer state.

## Team Use

If diffStory is in a private repository, each teammate needs normal GitHub access
first, the same as cloning the repo. Each teammate installs and opens the macOS
app; there is no CLI installation path.

A teammate can replay a walkthrough when they have:

1. the same branch or commit range checked out
2. access to the story file your team chose to share
3. the diffStory app installed locally

They open the app, pick the repo, and open the saved story. No agent is needed
just to read an existing walkthrough.

## From Source

Use this when you are developing diffStory itself:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/naveedinno/diffStory.git
cd diffStory
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app opens at `http://localhost:7777/`. If the browser does not open
automatically, open the printed URL yourself.

That is the whole core setup. You do not need Python, Homebrew, Claude, or Codex
just to open the app and review diffs. Narration uses the separate Aloud app.

Useful development commands:

| Command | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Build and run the internal web server for development. |
| `npm run build` | Compile `src/` into `dist/`. |
| `npm run start` | Run the built internal development server. |
| `npm run demo` | Build and open a sample review. |
| `npm test` | Build and run the test suite. |

## Narration With Aloud

diffStory delegates narration to Aloud instead of loading voice models or
managing audio itself. Install Aloud's Services, choose your voice, model,
speed, and playback mode in Aloud, then use **Play story** or a step's play
button in diffStory. Playback stays in Aloud's shared reader and menu-bar
session.

When Aloud is unavailable, diffStory leaves the review usable and shows how to
enable narration. No Aloud model, cache, or voice preference is stored by
diffStory.

## Troubleshooting

**The app does not open**

Re-run `./scripts/install-macos-app.sh` from the source checkout, then open
**diffStory** from Spotlight, Finder, or Launchpad.

**A repo is not accepted**

The folder must be a git repository. Open the folder that contains `.git`, or
paste that path into the project picker.

**Story generation says skills are missing or stale**

Click **Update skills** in the app, or rerun:

```sh
./scripts/install-skills.sh
```

from a diffStory clone.

**No Claude or Codex is found**

Install one of them and make sure its command is available on your PATH. You can
still read diffs without an agent.

## How It Works

The diffStory desktop app starts its private local Node server and renders the UI. The server
reads your local git repository, renders the diff, stores review state in
`.diffstory/`, and can ask Claude or Codex to generate or repair a story.

The app uses Node built-ins for its runtime server. It does not need a hosted
service, database, browser extension, or cloud account.
