// The server-side HTML shell for the React surfaces.
//
// Every diffStory page used to be a complete, self-contained document: ~300 KB
// of hand-written markup with all CSS and JS inlined from `page-assets.ts`.
// This module replaces that with the smallest document that can boot a React
// bundle without a flash of the wrong theme:
//
//   1. `<meta charset>` / viewport / color-scheme / theme-color
//   2. the inline theme bootstrap (must run before first paint — see below)
//   3. the brand favicon + mask-icon links
//   4. `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/client/app.css">`
//   5. `<div id="root">` (optionally holding a boot placeholder)
//   6. `<script type="application/json" id="__DIFFSTORY_DATA__">` — the view-model
//   7. `<script type="module" src="/assets/client/<surface>.js">`
//
// Ordering is load-bearing, not cosmetic:
//
// - The theme bootstrap stays INLINE and stays in `<head>`, ahead of the
//   stylesheet. It reads the `ds-theme` localStorage preference and stamps
//   `data-theme` / `data-theme-mode` / `color-scheme` on `<html>` before the
//   first paint. Move it to an external file (or below the stylesheet) and a
//   light-mode user gets a dark flash on every navigation, because the CSS in
//   `theme.ts` declares dark as the no-script fallback.
// - The stylesheet is render-blocking, which is what we want: it means the boot
//   placeholder and the first React paint both land with tokens already
//   resolved.
// - The module script is deferred by definition, so it never blocks the
//   placeholder.
//
// This module renders markup only. It does not read the repository, the
// session, or the filesystem — callers hand it a fully built, serializable
// payload. That keeps it trivially testable and keeps the "what does this
// surface need?" question answerable by reading one route handler.

 * How long the entry module is allowed to hold up the first paint.

 * Matched to the boot placeholder's own 240 ms reveal, and that is the whole
 * argument: the release is the moment we give up and let the shell paint, so if
 * it lands before the dots are due the user gets a bare page with nothing on it
 * to explain the wait. Landing exactly on the reveal means whenever the shell
 * does appear, the placeholder is already due to appear with it.
 *
 * It is NOT tuned to the slowest surface's first commit, which is the obvious
 * theory and is wrong. Measured warm, the review and raw-diff surfaces commit
 * around 300 ms — well past this budget — yet neither paints an empty shell at
 * 200 ms, 240 ms or 400 ms. The reason is that a `setTimeout` cannot fire while
 * the main thread is synchronously evaluating a 346 kB module: on a CPU-bound
 * boot the release callback does not get to run until after the module (and so
 * after the `flushSync` commit inside it), which makes it a no-op exactly when
 * it would have hurt. The bound therefore protects the NETWORK-bound case,
 * where the thread is idle waiting on bytes and the timer really does fire —
 * which is the case that produced the 4.4 s blank rectangle below.
 *
 * Raising it buys nothing measurable and lengthens the one case that does pay:
 * a cold start, where there is no previous page to hold and the browser shows
 * its own `color-scheme` background for the duration. On a navigation the held
 * frame is the page the user was already looking at, which beats an empty one.

 * window between the stylesheet landing and React's first commit. Measured on
 * this machine that race went either way run to run, which is exactly the
 * "sometimes" in the bug report.
 *
 * Unbounded, though, it trades that for something worse. Throttled to 8x CPU on
 * a cold tab the entry takes ~4.4 s, and a render-blocked document shows a flat
 * untextured rectangle for every one of those seconds — no dot field, no boot
 * placeholder, nothing. That is the precise failure `bootPlaceholder()` exists
 * to prevent, so the blocking has to be bounded rather than absolute.

/**
 * Serialize a value for embedding in `<script type="application/json">`.
 *
 * This is the same technique `render.ts`'s private `jsonForDataScript()` already
 * uses for `#ds-initial-comments` and the move-annotation blocks; it is lifted
 * here (rather than imported) because `render.ts` is being deleted and this
 * becomes the one remaining copy.
 *
 * Why escaping `<` and `>` is sufficient, and why it is also necessary:
 *
 * - An HTML tokenizer inside a `<script>` element is in "script data" state. It
 *   does not decode entities, so `&amp;` would arrive at `JSON.parse` literally
 *   — we cannot use HTML escaping here. What it *does* do is watch for `</`
 *   (closes the element early) and for `<!--` (switches to script-data-escaped
 *   state, which then swallows a later `</script>` and leaves the document
 *   truncated). Both start with `<`.
 * - A six-character `<` sequence is a legal JSON escape for `<`, so
 *   replacing every `<` in the serialized text neutralizes `</script>`, `<!--`,
 *   `<script`, and `<!DOCTYPE` in one move, and `JSON.parse` restores the
 *   original characters exactly.
 * - `>` and `&` are escaped too. Neither is strictly required inside a script
 *   element, but escaping them means the same string is also safe if it is ever
 *   moved into an HTML comment, an attribute, or an XHTML/`CDATA` context.
 * - U+2028 / U+2029 are valid in JSON strings but are line terminators in
 *   pre-ES2019 JavaScript source. Escaping them keeps the text safe to paste
 *   into a `JSON.parse('...')` literal.
 * - Lone surrogates need no special handling: `JSON.stringify` has been
 *   well-formed since ES2019 (Node 12+) and emits them as `\udXXX` escapes
 *   rather than raw code units, so the output is always valid UTF-8 and
 *   round-trips through `JSON.parse` byte-for-byte.
 *
 * The one thing this does NOT do is validate that the payload is
 * JSON-serializable. `JSON.stringify` throws on cycles and on BigInt; a route
 * that hands us either has a bug worth surfacing loudly.

 * The shared boot placeholder.
 *
 * Recommendation (see the contract doc for the full argument): ship this, not a

 * skeleton would mostly be a flash, and five hand-maintained skeletons would
 * drift from five React layouts within a week. What a delayed brand mark buys
 * is the slow case only — a cold macOS-app launch, a large review page — where
 * an empty white/ink rectangle reads as "broken".
 *
 * The 240 ms `animation-delay` is the whole trick: the element is invisible
 * until then, so a boot that beats the delay shows nothing at all.
 * `prefers-reduced-motion` gets a plain opacity step instead of the pulse.
 *
 * That only became true when the `backwards` fill was removed. `backwards`
 * applies the FIRST KEYFRAME during the delay, and the first keyframe of
 * `ds-boot-pulse` is `opacity:.18` — so for its entire life this placeholder
 * did the opposite of what this note claimed, painting three grey dots from the
 * very first frame instead of staying hidden. It was visible 125 ms into a
 * navigation, caught frame-by-frame in a screencast. With no fill mode the base
 * `opacity:0` holds through the delay, which is what was always intended.
 *
 * React's `createRoot(...).render()` replaces the container's existing children
 * on its first commit, so no client-side teardown is required.
