# Contributing to diffStory

Thanks for helping make diff review calmer and more useful.

## Local Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/naveedinno/diffStory.git
cd diffStory
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app opens at `http://localhost:7777/`. Core development only needs Node.js
20+ and git. Claude, Codex, Python, Kokoro, and Homebrew are optional.

## Before Opening a PR

Run the same check CI runs:

```sh
npm run check
```

For release/package changes, also run:

```sh
npm run release:check
```

`npm run check` rebuilds `dist/`, so commit generated `dist/` changes whenever
you change `src/`. GitHub installs of this project depend on the checked-in
build output.

## Development Notes

- Keep `.diffstory/` local. Do not commit review sessions, comments, or generated
  story files unless a task explicitly asks for a shared example fixture.
- Prefer focused tests beside the behavior you change.
- Keep optional integrations optional. The plain diff viewer should keep working
  without AI agents or Kokoro voice setup.
- Use `npm run demo` when you want a realistic throwaway repo to review.

## Good First Changes

- Improve onboarding text.
- Add focused tests around review workflows.
- Polish the demo repo/story.
- Improve error messages when optional tools are missing.
