// Boot one React surface into the shell's `#root`.
//
// `createRoot(...).render()` replaces the container's existing children on its
// first commit, so the shell's delayed boot placeholder needs no teardown.
//
// StrictMode is deliberately NOT used. These surfaces manage real DOM state
// outside React — `inert` and `aria-hidden` on a background element, a close
// timer, focus restoration — and StrictMode's double-invoked effects make that
// choreography fire twice in development while behaving differently in the
// production bundle we actually ship. There is no dev/prod split here (esbuild
// always builds with NODE_ENV=production), so the only thing StrictMode could
// buy is a divergence from what users run.
