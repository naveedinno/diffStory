// "Remove <title> from this repo?" — the confirmation in front of a delete.
//
// The vanilla page used `window.confirm()` for this question and
// `window.alert()` for the failure. `surface-inventory.md` §2.7 flags that pair
// as an accessibility gap and names the only two honest replacements: keep the
// native dialogs, or build an accessible one. Deleting optimistically is NOT on
// that list, and a story file is not recoverable from this app.
//
// This is the second option, built on the shared modal choreography the folder
// browser already uses — the same rAF-then-class entrance, the same 210 ms exit
// hold, the same `inert` + `aria-hidden` background, the same focus trap and
// focus restore. Nothing new was invented for it.
//
// Two deliberate departures from the native dialogs, both improvements the
// native ones cannot offer:
//   - focus lands on Cancel, not on the destructive action;
//   - a failed delete reports inside the dialog and leaves it open, instead of
//     an `alert()` that dismisses the context along with itself.
//
// The destructive button is beUI's `StatefulButton`, which is a real
// idle → loading → error machine instead of a ternary on a label: it brings the
// spinner, `aria-busy`, and a label that becomes "Try again" once the delete has
// failed. It is also one of the twenty vendored components that ship a live
// region — an `aria-live="polite"` wrapper around its own label — so it is
// quieted here with `useQuietSubtree`. That is not a formality: this dialog
// already has an assertive announcer for the failure, and leaving the button's
// polite one in place would announce the reason and the button's new label as
// two separate events for the same failure. The error paragraph is passed to
// `keep`, which is exactly the case that option exists for.
