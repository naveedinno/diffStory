// The saved-review badge state machine.
//
// `server-shell-contract.md` calls this "the one piece of real logic on this
// surface", and it is pure presentation over a `StoryRowView`, so it ports as-is
// from `storyRow()` in the deleted `src/story-picker.ts`.
//
// ORDER IS THE BEHAVIOUR. First match wins, and two of the branches only make
// sense because of what precedes them:
//
//   - `Saved` sits second so that a payload built by `listStoryMetadata()` can
//     never fall through into a freshness verdict. That projection reports
//     `freshness: 'unverified'` and zeroes for additions/deletions/comments
//     because it never rebuilt the diff — presenting that as "Verify scope"
//     would be the page inventing a finding out of work it declined to do.
//   - `In review` outranks every freshness state: an open note is a person
//     waiting, and it matters more than whether the diff has moved.
//
// `Saved` is also the one label with no colour rule of its own; it falls through
// to the neutral badge. That is intentional, not an oversight.
